## Purpose

This is a small test projects for both `parcel` and `wasm (using rust)`.

## What does it do? 

Uhm ... 42?

## How to run & build

Make sure to install [parcel](https://parceljs.org), [rustup](https://rustup.rs) and [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/). All other dependencies will be automatically installed.

The package.json provides a `run` and `build` command. The first build might take some time, but afterwards its build incremental, so you'll have a blazing fast experience. :)

## Answers

* Where does the name come from? 

I was just searching for something short and catchy using r because of rust. :)
